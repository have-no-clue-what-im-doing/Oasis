	<p> 
	Broderic Duncan grew up near Cincinnati, in the small town of Amelia, Ohio. He is currently a third-year double majoring in Nutrition and Architecture. In his free time, he enjoys dicking around on the guitar. Over the course of 2 years he's almost able to play the notorious F chord. Fortunately, most Oasis songs rely on only simple power chords. Lately, he's been living vicariously through Liam and Noel and taking inspiration from them. Right now his new band, Deathamphetamine, is working on their first single, Skunk in The Trunk. Date for gig at Bogart's TBD.

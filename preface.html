	<p> 
	This website is for fans of Oasis and people who don't know who the hell Oasis is. When people hear the band Oasis, they probably think of Wonderwall and that's about it. But here, on this website, I want to let you know that they are far more than just Wonderwall. They are a bunch of crazy lunatic dumbasses. If reading and watching famous idiots do dumb shit is entertaining, then this is the band for you. If you like rock music with highly distorted guitars, atrocious vocals, and lyrics that make absolutely no sense, then this is also the band for you.
	</p>
	<p>
	I decided to make this website from scratch, which was a really dumb idea. As always, it took way longer to create the site than initially expected. I put about 10 times more time and effort into the website than into any of the actual writing assignments. I just don't think Oasis fans care about reading an annotated bibliography or a genre and discourse analysis. They're more interested in the experience of the website as a whole. Does it look cool? Is there music I can listen to? Are there any videos I can watch? 
	</p>
	<p>
	For the homepage, I just slapped on Oasis' Supersonic documentary trailer. That two minute video gives a great introduction on who Oasis is. It shows how big they were at their peak. Most Americans are pretty oblivious to how popular Oasis was in the UK. Also on the home page is Liam's, Noel's, and the official Oasis' Twitter accounts. I suggest reading through Liam's Twitter. He uses so much random slang that I don't even think most British people know what he's even saying. Below the Twitter, timelines are Spotify playlists. The left and right ones are their first two albums and the middle one is a playlist of their best songs I curated myself. At the very top of each page, there is a random quote from either Liam or Noel. A new quote will appear after each refresh.
	</p>
	<p> 
	I'm not sure if I actually have to credit all the images used on this site. I'm hoping not. But I would like to say I shamelessly stole the favicon from the official Oasis site and just slapped it on here. Also shoutout to bing images and youtube as well. 
	</p>
	<p> If you're interested in learning more about Oasis's stupid antics, I suggest visiting the policy of truth page. If you're a huge nerd who wants to read about the discourse surrounding Oasis during their rise to fame, then I suggest visiting the analysis page. </p>
	<p> Cheers! </p>

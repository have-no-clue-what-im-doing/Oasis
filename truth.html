	<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;"> Why Oasis Is The Dumbest Band Ever </h2>
	<h2> Fights and Drama </h2>
	<p> Liam and Noel had way too many fights that resulted in cancled concerts and tours. Not only were tours cancelled, but it affected the well-being and performance of the rest of the band. The drama surrounding the Gallagher brothers resulted in lackluster tours in the US that destroyed any potential of breaking into the US market. </p>
	<p> The first example of a tour being cancelled due to stupidity was when the band confused crystal meth for coke. </p>

	</video>
	<p> They would go on to play the rest of the gig even after the argument, but Noel decided to quit and not show up for the next couple gigs they had scheduled. He would eventually return but destroyed all momentum they had going in the US at the time.
	<p> Their next act of stupidity would occur when they got deported from the Netherlands. While on a ferry towards the Netherlands, the boys got shitfaced and decided to fight a group of guys that were talking shit. The fight got them arrested and deported back to the UK, forcing them to cancled their gig. </p>
	<p> Of course the Gallagher brothers had to capitlize on their ferry incident. During an interview they decided to have a 15 minute long argument over if getting into a fight was "rock 'n' roll." This interview was recorded and later came to be known as the "Wibbling Rivalry" Here's the first half of the fight: </p>

	<p> In 1996, right after their release of <i> (What's The Story) Morning Glory? </i> they got a chance to do a set on MTV's Unplugged. Liam, being the singer, was supposed to sing for this event. But of couse, Liam decided not to, stating he had a sore throat. Noel would go on to take over as the singer for the set while Liam hurled insults from the stands with his "sore throat." </p>

	<p> This was now the second time Oasis had made a bad impression on their American audience. </p>
	<p> Finally, in 2009, Oasis would finally end. During a tour in Paris, the brothers got into a fight so bad that Liam decided to attack Noel with his guitar. Noel instantly fled the stage and announced he had quit Oasis for good. Their fighting had finally caught up to them. </p>
	<h2> Plagiarism </h2>
	<p> It's no secret that Noel took an influence from many bands when writing his melodies and lyrics. Unfortunately, Noel took it a little too far, to the point he's actually been sued over it. Here's a list of the times Oasis has been accused of plagiarism / copyright infringement:
	<p> Noel admitted to stealing the main riff from Bowie's song "All the Young Dudes" He is quoted with saying: "I've had two songs out of that now: 'Don't Look Back in Anger' and 'Stand by Me' And he's still not sued me yet." </p>
	<p> Noel stole a melody from Monty Python's "How Sweet To Be An Idiot" for his song "Whatever" Oasis was sued for this and Monty Python won songwriting credit for the song.
	</p>
	<p>
	Noel was sued by Coca-Cola for stealing the melody to Coca-Cola's jingle "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing" Noel had used the melody for his song "Shakermaker" He was forced to pay Coca-Cola $500,000 in damages.
	</p>
	
	<h2> B Sides </h2>
	<p> One of the dumbest things Oasis did was put a bunch of their really great songs on as B sides.  This was something the Beatles did where they'd put some of their songs as B sides and release them as singles instead. Well, Oasis didn't even bother releasing their B side songs as singles, they just slapped them on the record, hidden away. Since this was also the mid-90s, people weren't buying records anymore, they were buying CDs. Oasis had so many great B-sides that they released an entire album just consisting of them: </p>

	<p> Songs like Acquiesce, Rockin' Chair, Headshrinker, Half The World Away, Cloudburst, and The Masterplan, could've easily been saved for their third album. Instead, we got <i> Be Here Now, </i> which sucks.</p>
	<h2> Horrible Lyrics </h2>
	
	<p> Oasis isn't really known for having the most poetic of lyrics. For the most part they're all just a bunch of syllables that happen to ryhme. Here are some examples: </p>
	<h4> <i> Champagne Supernova </i> </h4>
	<i>
	<p> Slowly walking down the hall <br> Faster than a cannonball </p> </i>
	<p> Yes, cannonballs are known for going very, very slow </p>
	<i> <p> Someday you will find me <br>
Caught beneath the landslide <br>
In a champagne supernova in the sky </p> </i>
<p> This literally makes no sense at all no matter how you look at it. It's not even really a coherent sentence in the slightest. Obviously a champagne supernova isn't really a thing, but what the hell does a landslide have to do with any of that? </p>
	<h4> <i> Some Might Say </i> </h4>
	<p> <i> The sink is full of fishes <br>
She's got dirty dishes on the brain <br>
It was overflowing gently <br>
But it's all elementary my friend </i> </p>
<p> I know not all lyrics should have to make sense, it is poetry after all. But this is ridiculous and just seems like lazy writing. Noel seemed to only care about the melody and not so much the actual lyrics. My theory is that since Liam got to sing all this, that Noel purposely wrote shitty lyrics just because he'd think it'd be funny to listen to his brother sing absolute nonsense. </p>

	<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;"> Yeah, so originally I was going to research Arctic Monkeys. Glad I didn't cause  after listening to them a couple more times, they sound like complete shit. Hopefully Tegan has a change of mind as well. </p>
	<h3> A common popular music critical trope is the comparison of the early work to the most recent work.  Using your research topic, critically compare the early work with the latest work.   Reply to two peers. </h3>

	<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;"> Santos, if you're gonna address me by my last name you better put a "Mr." in front of it next time! </p>
	<h3> Critics and artists may share one (and perhaps only one) pastime: talking shit about critics. Using your research, write a review of one your research topic’s albums, and savage a critic that you feel got it totally wrong.  Reply to two peers. </h3>

	<h3> In a real sense, this semester has been about waiting and being ready for something new.  This is why you self-selected a topic, and researched, to find something new.  It might finding something new about your favorite artist(s); it might also be about discovering something new about yourself and your relationship to your topic through writing.

Tell us what you have been waiting and ready (or not ready) for while working on this portfolio.   Reply to two peers. </h3>

This was my final project for my English class. Final project had to be about a band/artist. Made the website in about a week from scratch. One issue I had was with the random quote generator I had going on. I used JavaScript to make it and it omits apostrophes within the quotes. Something I will fix eventually. Professor was very chill and didnâ€™t care if you joke around a bit with your project.
